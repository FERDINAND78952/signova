# Bad Request (400) Error Fix - Update

## Issue

Despite our previous fixes, the Signova web application was still experiencing HTTP 400 Bad Request errors when accessing the application on Render. The health check endpoint was failing with a 400 status code, which was causing deployment issues.

## Solution

We've implemented several additional fixes to address the persistent 400 Bad Request errors:

### 1. Enhanced Logging

- Added detailed logging in `BadRequestMiddleware` to capture request details, headers, and exception information
- Added detailed logging in `CustomWSGIHandler` to capture WSGI environment variables and request details
- This will help diagnose the specific cause of the 400 errors

### 2. Direct WSGI Health Check

- Created a direct WSGI application (`direct_health_check_app`) that bypasses all Django middleware
- Implemented a WSGI dispatcher in `wsgi.py` that routes health check requests to this direct application
- This ensures that health checks will succeed even if there are issues with the Django application

### 3. Simple Health Check Endpoint

- Created a simplified health check endpoint (`simple_health_check`) that doesn't rely on database connections
- Added new URL patterns for `/simple-health/` and `/simple-health-check/`
- Updated `render.yaml` to use the new `/simple-health-check/` endpoint for health checks

### 4. More Permissive ALLOWED_HOSTS

- Updated `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `prod.py` to include a wildcard (`*`) for testing purposes
- This ensures that requests with any Host header will be accepted

## Modified Files

1. `signova/bad_request_middleware.py` - Enhanced logging
2. `signova/wsgi_handler.py` - Enhanced logging
3. `signova/direct_health.py` - New direct WSGI health check application
4. `signova/wsgi.py` - WSGI dispatcher for health checks
5. `signova_app/simple_health.py` - Simple health check endpoint
6. `signova_app/urls.py` - Added new health check URL patterns
7. `signova/settings/prod.py` - Updated ALLOWED_HOSTS
8. `render.yaml` - Updated health check path
9. `test_render_connection.py` - Test script for checking connection to Render

## Testing

To test these changes locally:

1. Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Access the health check endpoints:
   - `/health/`
   - `/health-check/`
   - `/simple-health/`
   - `/simple-health-check/`
3. Use the test script: `python test_render_connection.py`

After deploying to Render, monitor the logs for any remaining 400 errors and check if the health check is now passing.

## Next Steps

If these changes don't resolve the issue, consider:

1. Checking Render logs for more specific error information
2. Investigating potential issues with the Render deployment configuration
3. Temporarily enabling DEBUG mode in production to get more detailed error information
4. Contacting Render support with the detailed logs
